# Cluster Analysis on Indian Companies

This project segments Indian companies based on ratings, reviews, jobs, salaries, and company age. By applying PCA, the data was reduced to two principal components for easier visualization, and clustering techniques like K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering identified two groups of companies:

Growing firms with higher reviews, jobs, and salaries.
Established firms with higher ratings and older ages.
The results provide insights into market segmentation, aiding strategic decision-making.
